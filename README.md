## Adversarial Energy Attack
This repository provides a sophisticated Adversarial Energy Attack algorithm targeting a couple of state-of-the-art DNNs. Specifically, we consider the following dataset and DNN pairs as targets to attack: MNIST on LeNet5, Fashion-MNIST on LeNet5, CIFAR10 on AlexNet, CIFAR100 on GoogleNet, ImageNet on ResNet18, and ImageNet on VGG16.

## How to run the project
Go to the Models folder and select a Dataset-DNN pair. Then, go to the selected Dataset-DNN pair folder and carry out the phases by number order (1, 2, 3, ...) by running the .py file in each folder. Arguments for each .py file are brought at the end of the .py file.
